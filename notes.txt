Ensure logging for exceptions is centralized and follows a consistent format (e.g., SLF4J with MDC for traceability).

API Documentation
Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints. This makes the service easier to consume and review for external developers.
8. Logging
Centralize logging configuration (e.g., logback.xml or log4j2.xml).
Use structured logging (e.g., JSON logs) for better observability in production.
Ensure sensitive information (e.g., passwords) is never logged.


Database Optimization:
Use indexed queries in repositories to prevent performance bottlenecks.
If possible, cache frequent queries (e.g., product listings) using Redis or a similar in-memory store.
Fault Tolerance: Add resilience patterns like circuit breakers (via Resilience4j or Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker).
